            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p class="background-paragraph">Hello. I'm Chef Karter, I  was raised an only child on the South side of Chicago by my two parents who are both English teachers.
                Due to my parent's busy schedule, I was mostly raised by my grandmother, Nana, as I lovingly called her.
                My Nana was raised in Baton Rouge, LA and spent every Saturday night preparing cajun dishes for Sunday dinner.
                As a little one, I would scoot a chair up to the counter and help her snap green beans or stir cake batter for her famous pineapple caramel cake.
                This is where my love for food began. Food represents family, love, and culture. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2001 I studied culinary arts at Howard University, and after graduation, was accepted into Le Cordon Bleu in London, England.
                After graduating from Cordon, I returned to the states and worked in a few restaurants in Chicago as a sous chef but had hopes of having my own restaurant.
                In 2010 my beloved Nana passed away and left behind an inheritence. I decided to take the money and invest in a small kitchen and Karter Catering Co. was born.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have been growing our client list ever since including The Chicago History Museum, birthday events for the Obama's, Riot Fest, and Chicago Pride.
                No event is too big or too small, any chance that I can prepare food for an event is a chance to share my rich Louisana/Chicago culture with my community.
